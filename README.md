Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to the Department of Computer System Engineering (DCSE) at the University of Engineering & Technology (UET), Peshawar. This repository is a curated collection of assignments, lab tasks, lab reports and projects that I've compiled during my journey through the Bachelor of Science program in Computer System Engineering.

### 1. First Semester (Fall 2021)
   - In this semester, our primary subject was **Computer Fundamentals (CF)**.
   - Our curriculum included fundamental software applications such as **MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint**, along with introductory programming concepts like **HTML, CSS**, and a basic understanding of **JavaScript**.
   - Lab reports related to coding assignments have been uploaded, providing insights into our practical work during this semester.
   - Explore my work for the first semester [here](./semester_1_(fall-21)).

### 2. Second Semester (Spring 2022)
   - In the second semester, our primary subject was **Computer Programming (CP)**, which was divided into two parts: theory and lab.
   - The course focused on **procedural programming in C++**, covering essential topics such as data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, pointers, and structures.
   - To delve into this semester's coursework, you can navigate to the following sections:
     - [CP Theory](./semester_2_(spring-22)/Computer%20Programming%20Theory/)
     - [CP Lab](./semester_2_(spring-22)/Computer%20Programming%20Lab)
   - Discover my work for the second semester [here](./semester_2_(spring-22)/).

### 3. Third Semester (Fall 2022)
   - In the third semester, our subject was **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, which also included both theory and lab components.
   - We learned **object-oriented programming concepts in C++**, covering topics such as classes, objects, constructors, data members, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading.
   - Explore my work for the third semester in the following sections:
     - [OOP Theory](./semester_3_(fall-22)/Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20Theory)
     - [OOP Lab](./semester_3_(fall-22)/Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20Lab)
   - Dive into my work for the third semester [here](./semester_3_(fall-22)/).

### 4. Fourth Semester (Spring 2023)
   - In the fourth semester, we are covering a diverse range of subjects including **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Operating Systems (OS), and Signals and Systems (SS)**.
   - This semester's coursework is divided into theory and lab components for each subject:
     - [DSA Theory](./semester_4_(spring-23)/data_structures_and_algorithms)
     - [DSA Lab](./semester_4_(spring-23)/data_structures_and_algorithms_lab)
     - [OS Lab](./semester_4_(spring-23)/operating_systems_lab)
     - [SS Lab](./semester_4_(spring-23)/signals_&_systems_lab)
   - Feel free to explore my work for the fourth semester [here](./semester_4_(spring-23)/).
  
### 5. Fifth Semester (Fall 2023)
   - In progress...

This repository will continually evolve as I progress through my studies in Computer System Engineering at UET, Peshawar. Stay tuned for updates, and if you're a fellow student, don't hesitate to collaborate and share your insights to enhance our collective learning experience.
