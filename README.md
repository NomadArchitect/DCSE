This repository contains Assignments and Lab Reports of my BS in Computer System Engineering.

### 1. First Semester:
   * (fall 2021)
   * In this semeseter our subject is __Computer Fundamentals (CF)__.
   * Mostly we have thaught basics such as **MS World, Excel, Powerpoint** etc. 
   * Along with this we had also taught **HTML, CSS** and a little of **JAVA SCRIPT**.
   * I have only uploaded 4 lab reports because other were not associated with coding.
   * Here you can [view my work](https://github.com/aimalexe/DCSE/tree/main/semester_1_(fall-21))


### 2. Second Semester:
   * (Spring 2022)
   * In this semeseter our subject is __Computer Programming (CP)__. This subject has two parts
      * [CP Theory](https://github.com/aimalexe/DCSE/tree/main/semester_2_(spring-22)/Computer%20Programming%20Theory/)
      * [CP Lab](https://github.com/aimalexe/DCSE/tree/main/semester_2_(spring-22)/Computer%20Programming%20Lab)
   * Here you can [view my work](https://github.com/aimalexe/DCSE/tree/main/semester_2_(spring-22)/)
   * In this course we have taught __procedural programming__ in cpp. The main content was data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, pointers, structures. 


### 3. Third Semester:
   * (Fall 2022)
   * In this semeseter our subject is __Object Oriented Programming (OOP)__. This subject has two parts
