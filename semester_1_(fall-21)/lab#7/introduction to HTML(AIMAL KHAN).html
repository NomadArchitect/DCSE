   <p><font size="+3" color="yellow" face="mongolian baiti">The word <i>‘hiking’</i> means a <b>“journey on foot”</b> So, hiking means to walk or to tramp. And such walkers and trampers are found everywhere in the world. Some men are extraordinarily great hikers. Their main interest is hiking. They climb up the hills and mountains, walk along the banks of a river and tramp through the fields. There are many places for hiking. But the question arises-what are the benefits of hiking? Has hiking got any merit? Is it a good physical exercise?</font>

   <p><font size="+3" face="segoe script">First of all, <b>hiking is a kind of physical exercise</b>. While walking, the various limbs of our body move. Our legs, arms and other parts of the body are in motion. Therefore, it provides good physical exercise that keeps us physically fit.</font>
   </p>
   
   
   <p><font size="+3"><i><b>Hiking through the countryside</b> gives us a feeling of being independent. There is independence of the mind as well</i>. We are away from the noise and din of the city life. While walking through a countryside, which is very calm and quiet, we feel at peace. We walk as we wish. No discipline and etiquette are required to be observed. We can chat and gossip freely and for a long period of time. Moreover, while hiking, we can give a free vent to our emotions and feelings. Our suppressed thoughts can be expressed during our hiking tours.<u><font color="white">You can click this picture of Kalam to see more beautyfull pictures of this area</font></u></font>

   <p><font size="+3"><b>The third advantage of hiking is that we take in plenty of fresh air</b>. The pure air of the gardens and hills, the open places and meadows are loaded with the sweet fragrance of the flowers and are withou0t any dirt or dust. The cool and clear breeze revitalises our life and limbs</font>
   </p>
     <p align=center><img src="hike3.jpg" width=300 height=200></p>
   
   
   <p><font size="+3">Another merit which walking tours provide us, is that we can enjoy the scenes, sights and sounds of nature. We can see nature in various moods and colours. We can hear the gurgling of the brooks, the splash of the waterfalls, see the lush green meadows and pastures and gaze at the bewitching mountains and hilltops, covered with densely grown trees and plants. The lively beauty of nature thrills us. Indeed, fervour and zest are inducted into our life.</font>
   </p>
   
   <p><font size="+3">Hiking enables us to feel <i>fresh, healthy and sturdy</i>. <u>! Hiking is a medicine for some patients</u> while it is a good exercise for most of us. After walking through the countryside, one builds up an appetite and thus enjoys a hearty meal. Hiking wards off dullness and boredom from life. It drives away the blues.</font>
   </p>
   
   
   <p><font face="microsoft phagspa" size="+3">While on a hiking trip, one enjoys all the beauties and bounties of nature. The entire nature clothed in green, is enjoyed by us to our heart’s content. Nature ! appears before us as a great teacher, healer and consoler. It gives us a moral lesson ,<b> “And this our life, exempt from public haunts, finds tongues in trees, books in running brooks, sermons in stones and God in everything.”</b></font>
