# Q NO 2: Write a program thatâ€™s show the bit position of a number is 0 or 1. (Hint if number is 5 it is represented by 0101 show the 4th bit position is 0, similarly if the user enters 9 then the binary equivalent is 1001. In this case the 4th bit position is 1).

    # Check the 4th bit:
        #   To check whether the 4th bit is 0 or 1, we use a bitwise AND operation. We load the value 0x08 into $t1, which is the binary representation of 0000 1000. This value has all bits set to 0 except the 4th bit.
        #   We then perform an AND operation between the user input $t0 and the mask $t1. If the 4th bit of $t0 is 1, the result of the AND operation will be non-zero. If it's 0, the result will be 0.
