## Lab 02: Layout of Program, Library Function Calls and error handling

### 2.1. Layout of a Program Image

After loading, the program executable appears to occupy a contiguous block of memory called a program image. Above figure shows a sample layout of a program image in its logical address space. The program image has several distinct sections. The program text or code is shown in low-order memory. The initialized and uninitialized static variables have their own sections in the image. Other sections include the heap, stack and environment.

An activation record is a block of memory allocated on the top of the process stack to hold the execution context of a function during a call. Each function call creates a activation record on the stack. The activation record is removed from the stack when  function returns, providing the last-called-first-returned order for nested function.

The activation record contains the return address, the parameters (whose values are copied from the corresponding arguments), status information and a copy of some of the CPU register values at the time of the call. The process restores the register values return from the call represented by the record. The activation record also contains  variables that are allocated within the function while it is executing. The particular format for an activation record depends on the hardware and on the programming language.

In addition to the static and automatic variables, the program image contains space for argc and argv and for allocations by malloc. The malloc family of functions allocates storage from a free memory pool called the heap. Storage allocated on the heap persists until it is freed or until the program exits. If a function calls malloc, the storage allocated after the function returns. The program cannot access the storage after the return unless it has a pointer to the storage that is accessible after the function returns.

Static variables that are not explicitly initialized in their declarations are to 0 at run time. Notice that the initialized static variables and the uninitialized static occupy different sections in the program image. Typically, the initialized static are part of the executable module on disk, but the uninitialized static variables are not.  course, the automatic variables are not part of the executable module because they are only allocated when their defining block is called. The initial values of automatic variables are undetermined unless the program explicitly initializes them.

Task 1: Write two C programs for the analysis of the difference in executable file sizes while using:
1. Uninitialized Static Variables
2. Initialized Static Variables
Use ls -l to compare the sizes of the executable modules for the above two C programs.

### 2.2. Return Values and Error Handling 

    Traditional UNIX functions usually return â€“1 (or sometimes NULL) and set errno toindicate the error. The POSIX standards committee decided that all new functions would not use errno and would instead directly return an error number as a function return value.
#### 2.2.1. Perror:
SYNOPSIS
```c
 #include <stdio.h>
 void perror(const char *s);
```
No return values and no errors are defined for perror. The perror function outputs to standard error a message corresponding to the current value of errno. If s is not NULL, perror outputs the string (an array of characters terminated by a null character) pointed to by s and followed by a colon and a space. Then, perror outputs an error message corresponding to the current value of errno followed by a newline.

#### 2.2.2. Strerror:
The strerror function returns a pointer to the system error message corresponding to 
the error code errnum.
SYNOPSIS
```c
 #include <string.h>
 char *strerror(int errnum);
```
If successful, strerror returns a pointer to the error string. No values are reserved for failure. 

Use strerror to produce informative messages, or use it with functions that return error codes directly without setting errno. The strerror function may change errno. 

You should save and restore errno if you need to use it again. Correctly handing errno is a tricky business. Because its implementation may call other functions that set errno, a library function may change errno, even though the man page doesn't explicitly state that it does. Also, applications cannot change the string returned from strerror, but subsequent calls to either strerror or perror may overwrite this string.

Another common problem is that many library calls abort if the process is interrupted by 
a signal. Functions generally report this type of return with an error code of EINTR. For example, the close function may be interrupted by a signal. In this case, the error was not due to a problem with its execution but was a result of some external factor. Usually the program should not treat this interruption as an error but should restart the call. The problem of restarting library calls is so common that a library of restarted calls is provided with prototypes defined in restart.h. The functions are designated by a leading r_ prepended to the regular library name. For example, the restart library designates a restarted version of close by the name r_close.

Task 2: Analyze the return values and error numbers/error stings of wait system call on:
1. Success
2. Failure


Using:
1. Strerror
2. Perror

SYNOPSIS
```c
 #include <sys/wait.h>
 pid_t wait(int *stat_loc);
```
 
Task 3: Analyze the return values and error numbers/error stings of close system call on:
1. Success
2. Failure

Using:
1. Strerror
2. Perror


SYNOPSIS
```c
 #include <unistd.h>
 int close(int fildes);
```
